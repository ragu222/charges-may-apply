##Description
The goal of this project is to text an alert to a mobile number when a cell in a Google Sheet falls below a certain value


##Instructions
Spin up a linux server. This example uses Ubuntu 14.04, so if you're using something else you're obviously going to have to replace 'apt' with 'yum', etc. (Just use Ubuntu)

First install the **sendemail** app and it's dependencies
`sudo apt-get install libio-socket-ssl-perl libssl-dev sendemail`

and configure it

`sudo apt-get install pip`
`sudo apt-get install lib`
